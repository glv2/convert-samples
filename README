  -i <file>  [default: stdin]
    Read input samples from 'file'.
  -o <file>  [default: stdout]
    Write output samples to 'file'.

Supported formats:
  - s8: signed 8 bit integer
  - u8: unsigned 8 bit integer
  - s16: signed 16 bit integer
  - u16: unsigned 16 bit integer
  - s32: signed 32 bit integer
  - u32: unsigned 32 bit integer
  - f32: 32 bit float
  - cs8: complex made of signed 8 bit integers
  - cu8: complex made of unsigned 8 bit integers
  - cs16: complex made of signed 16 bit integers
  - cu16: complex made of unsigned 16 bit integers
  - cs32: complex made of signed 32 bit integers
  - cu32: complex made of unsigned 32 bit integers
  - cf32: complex made of 32 bit floats


## Examples

Convert samples from the cf32 format used by GNU Radio to the cs8 format used
by HackRF:

    convert-samples -f cf32 -t cs8 -i samples.cf32 -o samples.cs8


Convert samples from the cu8 format used by RTL-SDR to the cs16 format used
by BladeRF:

    convert-samples -f cu8 -t cs16 -i samples.cu8 -o samples.cs16
